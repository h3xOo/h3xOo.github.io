Alekhine Defense
================

# Brief summary


Alekhine's Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 Nf6. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4.
