Wing Gambit
===========

# Brief summary


Wing Gambit. In chess, a Wing Gambit is an opening in which White plays an early b4, deflecting an enemy pawn or bishop from c5 so as to regain control of d4, an important central square. (Or in which Black plays ...b5, but Wing Gambits offered by Black are very rare.) The most common Wing Gambit is in the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.b4).
