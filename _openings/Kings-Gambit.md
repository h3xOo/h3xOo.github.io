King’s Gambit
=============

# Brief summary


The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. f4. White offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn with central domination, or direct their forces against the weak square f7 with moves such as Nf3, Bc4, 0-0, and g3.
