Vienna Game
===========

# Brief summary


The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves: . 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3. White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent. The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in modern play White often plays more quietly (for example, by fianchettoing his king's bishop with g3 and Bg2).
